// I don't know if you said to remove the scanner or not, as well as the public static etc, but I believe I am supposed to so I removed both of them anyways VIA 
// comments.

// Essentially the idea of this program is to allow the user to run the game directly from their console as long as they have this code installed on 
// their machine. It allows for a player to play and have two opporunities to guess a random color that the game has randomized and chosen. If they
// guess incorrectly both times, then they lose. If they guess correctly, then they win.
